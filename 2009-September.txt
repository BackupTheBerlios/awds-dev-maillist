Subject: [Awds-dev] AWDS with ZigBee and BlueTooth
Message-ID: <200909270602.n8R62qCi003814@singularity.tronunltd.com>

Hello,


  I found your project when I was looking for IP mesh 
networking solutions - with ZigBee and BlueTooth in mind.  I 
know your project is aimed at 802.11 ad-hoc networking, but 
the principles seem to map well to 802.15.4 and 802.15.1 
meshes too.

  Like BlueTooth, ZigBee has a communications stack that 
ends in a generic socket interface - or a serial port, with 
another layer of software;
    http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/linux-zigbee

  What I would like to do is deploy a homogeneous 
environment of mobile Linux devices with both ZigBee (for 
long range) and BlueTooth (a back-up short range) capability, 
giving each device a layer-3/IP address on each network 
(ZB/BT) and then let the nodes "stumble" into each other as 
they pass by at the various radio levels.  Effectively, I would 
like to replace the 802.11 hardware layer in your stack.

  Has anyone (developer or user) looked at AWDS on 
ZigBee or BlueTooth?  Any success or pointers?


Thanks,
