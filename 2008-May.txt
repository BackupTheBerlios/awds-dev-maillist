Subject: [Awds-dev] Interfaces
Message-ID: <c60ab7b20805140753l494e6e20p6dbb3e6dde62dfb0@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to know how  I can do to obtain the interface on which I received a
Beacon Packet. (In case we have more than one interface).
I tried to add something to recv_packet like (h == base->recvHandle) but I
get errors because it's a static member function.

It could be the NodeId of the interface or something else.

Thank you

Stefano
