Subject: [Awds-dev] queue size ?
Message-ID: <fca78b970907060558l4f1cd5f2ld61bb09ccf3597a5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm trying to understand how the sending part works in awds. I ran tests
with iperf, and the queue size (in Sendqueue.cc) is always 1 or 2, even when
I send at a very high rate.
I'm wondering in which case this queue will be full ?

Also, I noticed cpu usage increases with the sending rate.
Do you think it could be mainly caused by the time to put data in the real
network queue ? or is it something else?

regards,
Patrick.

If you are using TCP for bandwidth tests (which I assume with iperf),
the sending node is automatically regulating the number of packets to
send. It adapts to the available network capacity, so there is no
congestion and no packets are dropped from the queues. A queue can be
filled if you setup UDP transmission with a too high rate, or when many
stations compete for the bandwidth in a network.

There are several aspects which have to be covered, mainly it is the
forwarding and copying of packets from the userspace (app) to kernel
space (tun/tap), back to userspace (awds) and finally to the kernel
space (wifi driver). Of course, there is also other per-packet
processing which takes up some time.

There is a linux-kernel module in the AWDS source tree which can reduce
the CPU overhead by off-loading some of the tasks into the kernel.

Feel free to test it if you hit performance limits on your hardware
plattform.


Kind regards,

Georg
